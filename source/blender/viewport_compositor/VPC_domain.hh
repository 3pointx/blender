 * Domain
 *
 * A domain is a rectangular area of a certain size in pixels that is transformed by a certain
 * transformation in pixel space relative to some reference space.
 *
 * Any result computed by an operation resides in a domain. The size of the domain of the result is
 * the size of its texture. The transformation of the domain of the result is typically an identity
 * transformation, indicating that the result is centered in space. But a transformation operation
 * like the rotate, translate, or transform operations will adjust the transformation to make the
 * result reside somewhere different in space. The domain of a single value result is irrelevant
 * and always set to an identity domain.
 *
 * An operation operates in a certain domain called the operation domain, it follows that the
 * operation only cares about the inputs whose domain is inside or at least intersects the
 * operation domain. To abstract away the different domains of the inputs, any input that have a
 * different domain than the operation domain is realized on the operation domain through a
 * Realize On Domain Processor Operation, except inputs whose descriptor sets skip_realization or
 * expects_single_value, see InputDescriptor for more information. The realization process simply
 * projects the input domain on the operation domain, copies the area of input that intersects the
 * operation domain, and fill the rest with zeros or repetitions of the input domain; depending on
 * the realization_options, see the RealizationOptions class for more information. This process is
 * illustrated below, assuming no repetition in either directions. It follows that operations
 * should expect all their inputs to have the same domain and consequently size, except for inputs
 * that explicitly skip realization.

 *
 * Each operation can define an arbitrary operation domain, but in most cases, the operation domain
 * is inferred from the inputs. By default, the operation domain is computed as follows. Typically,
 * one input of the operation is said to be the domain input and the operation domain is inferred
 * from it. The domain input is determined to be the non-single value input that have the highest
 * domain priority, a zero value being the highest priority. If all inputs are single values, then
 * the operation domain is irrelevant and an identity domain is set. See Operation::compute_domain
 * for more information. If multiple inputs have the same domain priority, the first of which will
 * be considered to be the domain input.
 *
 * The aforementioned logic for operation domain computation is only a default that works for most
 * cases, but an operation can override the compute_domain method to implement a different logic.
 * For instance, output nodes have an operation domain the same size as the viewport and with an
 * identity transformation, their operation domain doesn't depend on the inputs at all.
 *
 * For instance, a filter operation have two inputs, a factor and a color, the latter of which
 * has a domain priority of 0 and the former has a domain priority of 1. If the color input is not
 * a single value, then the domain of this operation is computed to be the same size and
 * transformation as the color input, because it has the highest priority. And if the factor input
 * have a different size and/or transformation from the computed domain of the operation, it will
 * be projected and realized on it to have the same size as described above. It follows that the
 * color input, will not need to be realized because it already has the same size and
 * transformation as the domain of the operation, because the operation domain is inferred from it.
 * On the other hand, if the color input is a single value input, then the operation domain will be
 * the same as the domain of the factor input, because it has the second highest domain priority.
 * Finally, if both inputs are single value inputs, the operation domain will be an identity and is
 * irrelevant. */
