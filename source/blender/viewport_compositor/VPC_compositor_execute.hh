 * Consider the following node graph with a node execution schedule denoted by the number at each
 * node. Suppose that the compiler decided that nodes 2 to 5 are pixel-wise operations that can be
 * computed together in a single GPU shader. Then the compiler can construct a GPU Material
 * Operation from the sub-schedule containing nodes 2 to 5, compiling them into a GPU shader using

 * the GPU material, for instance, the links going from node 2 to node 3. However, links that cross
 * the boundary of the sub-schedule and link to nodes outside of it are handled separately.
 *
 * Any link between an input of a node that is part of the sub-schedule and an output of a node
 * that is not part of the sub-schedule is declared as an input to the operation and GPU material,
 * for instance, the links going from node 1 to node 2. The inputs and outputs involved in such
