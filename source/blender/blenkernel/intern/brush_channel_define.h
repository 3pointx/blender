/* Builtin brush channels are defined in this file.

When adding a new channel, the following other
places in rna_engine_codebase are relevent:

- brush_settings_map: use to convert to/from settings structures in Brush
- dyntopo_settings_map: same as above but for DynTopoSettings
- brush_flags_map: used to convert bitflags
- BKE_brush_builtin_patch(): adds missing channels to channelsets
- BKE_brush_builtin_create(): adds channels to brushes based on brush type (Brush->sculpt_tool)
- BKE_brush_check_toolsettings: adds missing channels to tool settings
- BKE_brush_channelset_ui_init: Configures UI visibility for channels based on brush type
